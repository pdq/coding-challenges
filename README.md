# coding-challenges
A repository for weekly coding challenges or other group projects

Every challenge will have its own top level directory. Sub-directories should be your name(or some other unique identifier) and should contain your solution.

Make sure to add any language specific gitignore things to the gitignore before committing. We don't want to end up with a bunch of artifacts committed.
